# DSP Class Practices in Octave

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a vast and fascinating domain of
electronics and computer science that focuses on the manipulation of
signals. Signals can be anything that carries information, and in the
digital realm, DSP is all about using digital techniques and algorithms
to transform, analyze, or interpret these signals.

The primary goal of DSP is to improve the accuracy and reliability of
digital communications by eliminating distortions and noise. In real-world
applications, DSP plays a crucial role in areas like audio processing,
image enhancement, voice recognition, and many more.

In this repository, you will find practices carried out in the DSP class
using Octave, a high-level programming language primarily intended for
numerical computations. Octave serves as an excellent tool for
experimenting with mathematical concepts and visualizing data,
making it suitable for our DSP class practices.

## Running Octave Windows with Vcode

1. Install [Vcode]
2. Install [Octave]
3. Search Octave binaries in your system and copy the path. Example:
   `C:\Octave\Octave-6.2.0\mingw64\bin\octave-cli.exe`
4. Install extension [Octave for Vcode] and paste the path in the
   extension settings.
